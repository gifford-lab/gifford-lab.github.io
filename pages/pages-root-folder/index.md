  text: 'We describe protein interaction quantitation (PIQ), 
a computational method for modeling the magnitude and 
shape of genome-wide DNase I hypersensitivity profiles to 
identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites.'

  text: 'We have designed a unique system in yeast where we can control both sources of information so that the phenotype of a single chromosomal polymorphism can be measured in the presence of different cytoplasmic elements. With this system, we have shown that both the source of the mitochondrial genome and the presence or absence of a dsRNA virus influence the phenotype of chromosomal variants that affect the growth of yeast.'

  title: "GERV: a statictical method for generative evaluation of regulatory variants for trancription factor binding"
  url: '/research/Chris'
  image: gerv-img2.jpg
  text: 'GERV (generative evaluation of regulatory variants), is a novel computational
method for predicting regulatory variants that affect transcription factor binding. We show that GERV outperforms existing methods
in predicting single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with allele-specific binding. GERV
correctly predicts a validated causal variant among linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms and
prioritizes the variants previously reported to modulate the binding of FOXA1 in breast cancer cell
lines. Thus, GERV provides a powerful approach for functionally annotating and prioritizing causal
variants for experimental follow-up analysis.'
