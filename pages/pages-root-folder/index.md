  title: "From DNase-seq to TF binding"
  url: '/research/PIQ'
  image: nbt-2.png
  text: 'We describe protein interaction quantitation (PIQ), 
a computational method for modeling the magnitude and 
shape of genome-wide DNase I hypersensitivity profiles to 
identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites.'
widget2:
  title: "Nonchromosomal effects on heritability"
  url: '/research/Matt'

  text: 'We have designed a unique system in yeast where we can control both sources of information so that the phenotype of a single chromosomal polymorphism can be measured in the presence of different cytoplasmic elements. With this system, we have shown that both the source of the mitochondrial genome and the presence or absence of a dsRNA virus influence the phenotype of chromosomal variants that affect the growth of yeast.'

  title: "Interpretation non-coding variants"
  url: '/research/GERV'
  image: gerv-img2.jpg
  text: 'We present GERV, a novel computational method for predicting regulatory variants that affect transcription factor binding. GERV learns a k-mer-based generative model of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data, and scores variants by the change of predicted ChIP-seq reads between the reference and alternate allele.'
