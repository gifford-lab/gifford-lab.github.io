  title: "Identification of Reproducible Genomic Interactions"
  url: '/research/idr2d'
  image: Krismer2019.png
  text: 'We introduce a generalization of the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) method called IDR2D that identifies replicable interactions shared by chromatin interaction experiments.'

  title: "Antibody Variable Domain Sequence Design"
  url: '/research/ensgrad'
  image: Liu2_2019.png
  text: 'Here, we present Ens-Grad, a machine learning method that can design complementarity determining regions of human Immunoglobulin G antibodies with target affinities that are superior to candidates derived from phage display panning experiments.'

  title: "Uncertainty in Peptide-MHC Binding Prediction"
  url: '/research/puffin'
  image: Zeng2_2019.jpg
  text: 'We introduce PUFFIN, a deep residual network-based computational approach that quantifies uncertainty in peptide-MHC affinity prediction that arises from observational noise and the lack of relevant training examples.'
