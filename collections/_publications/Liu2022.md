We introduce the maximum n-times coverage problem that selects k overlays to maximize the summed coverage of weighted elements, where each element must be covered at least n times. We also define the min-cost n-times coverage problem where the objective is to select the minimum set of overlays such that the sum of the weights of elements that are covered at least n times is at least Ï„. Maximum n-times coverage is a generalization of the multi-set multi-cover problem, is NP-complete, and is not submodular. We introduce two new practical solutions for n-times coverage based on integer linear programming and sequential greedy optimization. We show that maximum n-times coverage is a natural way to frame peptide vaccine design, and find that it produces a pan-strain COVID-19 vaccine design that is superior to 29 other published designs in predicted population coverage and the expected number of peptides displayed by each individual's HLA molecules.
