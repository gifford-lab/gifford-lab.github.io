Effective biologics require high specificity and limited off-target binding, but these properties are not guaranteed by current affinity-selection-based discovery methods. Molecular counterselection against off targets is a technique for identifying nonspecific sequences but is experimentally costly and can fail to eliminate
a large fraction of nonspecific sequences. Here, we introduce computational counterselection, a framework
for removing nonspecific sequences from pools of candidate biologics using machine learning models. We
demonstrate the method using sequencing data from single-target affinity selection of antibodies, bypassing
combinatorial experiments. We show that computational counterselection outperforms molecular counterselection by performing cross-target selection and individual binding assays to determine the performance
of each method at retaining on-target, specific antibodies and identifying and eliminating off-target, nonspecific antibodies. Further, we show that one can identify generally polyspecific antibody sequences using a
general model trained on affinity data from unrelated targets with potential affinity for a broad range of
sequences.
